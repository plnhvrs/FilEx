# FilEx

Adds or replaces extensions to files in a provided directory.

The command should be in the following format: FileExtender.exe <file location> <extension (e.g.".txt")> <search pattern ("*" to include all files)>

Optional arguments are:
-r - replaces the extension instead of adding it to the file name
-s - includes sub directories of the root folder
